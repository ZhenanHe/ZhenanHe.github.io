## A short introduction
Currently, I am mainly engaged in research on industrial intelligence, optimization methods, as well as deep learning. I have published several articles as the first author in leading journals and international conferences in the field of artificial intelligence, including *IEEE TEVC, IEEE TCYB, IEEE SMC, IEEE TNNLS, and IEEE CEC*, where I also served as the reviewer for those renowned journals and conferences, while I was awarded as the best reviewer in IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 2017. I hosted two National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), one State Key Laboratory Open Fund, and participated in two national major R&D projects as the main participant. Before joining Sichuan University, I worked in Energy New Technologies International, Houston, USA, on the research and development of intelligent control systems, while led and completed the application of robust high-dimensional multi-objective optimization techniques based on intelligent optimization algorithms in intelligent control systems.
